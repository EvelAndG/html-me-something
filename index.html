<h3>Thor: Ragnarock</h3>
<img src="smallThor.jpg" alt="Movie Poster for Thor Ragnarok">
<p>This is one of the funniest marvel movies with some of the best Thor action.
    Director, Taika Waititi, went a completely different direction than 
the previous Thor movies. This was a much needed change for the series.  </p>

    you'll find in the MCU. (Marvel Comic Universe)

<p>In my opinion, this is the best Spider-man movie made. I'm glad it was finally done right.
